##0 import Libraries and Data
```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(zoo)
library(lubridate)
df <- read_tsv("/Users/beneverad/Documents/MSc/1. Semester/data_collection_storage/Data/10760763.tsv",skip=5)
df1<-df
```
##0.5 Creating dttm
```{r}
df1$dttm <- paste(df1$date, df1$hm)
df1$dttm <- ymd_hms(df1$dttm)
df1 <- df1 %>% select (-c(id,date,hm))
#reorder
df1 <- df1[c("dttm", "ta", "lux")] 
df1 <- df1 %>% filter(dttm>= date("2018-12-10"))
```

##1.1 Measurement range
Checking whether the measured temperatures are in the measurable range. The HOBO manual determines the measurable range from -20 to +70
```{r}
#Hobo range
hobmin = -20
hobmax = 70
df1 <- df1 %>% mutate(qc1 = ifelse(ta>=hobmax | ta<=hobmin,1,0))
df1 %>% filter(qc1 == 1)
```
no rows were excluded

##1.2 Plausible rate of change
We check if the rate of change from one measurement to the next is higher than 1K. To do so, we mutate a control (ifelse) over the data, the control checks whether the absolute value of rollapply("diff") is higher or equal to 1 
```{r}
df2 <- df1 %>% mutate(qc2 = ifelse(abs(rollapply(ta, 
                               width = 2,
                               FUN = "diff",
                               align = "right",
                               fill = 0))>=1,1,0))
df2 %>% select(c(dttm,ta,qc2)) %>% filter(qc2==1)
```
17 rows where filtered out

##1.3 Minimum variability
We also flag a dataset, when temperatures haven't changed for 60 minutes. The function *allSame* is created, it checks a list whether all items are equal or not; returns True when the are all equal. The rollapply applies this function to the actual row and the 5 rows above.
```{r}
allSame <- function(x) length(unique(x)) == 1
df3 <- df2 %>% mutate(qc3 = 0+rollapply(ta,
                              width = 6,
                              FUN = allSame,
                              align ="right",fill=0))
df3 %>% select(c(dttm,ta,qc3)) %>% filter(qc3==1)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
